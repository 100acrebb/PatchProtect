<h1>PatchProtect</h1>

PatchProtect is a Prop Protection for Garry's Mod.
The special thing, is, that this Prop Protection also includes an AntiSpam-Fuction to reduce lags cause of Spam-Noobs.

<b>Note:</b> There is a PropProtection implemented in this addon, but it is not fully completed at the moment. We have to code some more things to get it working correctly, but if you want to use it now, you can do it!

<h1>Usage of PatchProtect</h1>
You can control the Settings in the <b>Q-Menu > Utilities</b>. There, if you are an admin, you can change all variables and also what should happen, if someone is spamming.
