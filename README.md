<h1>PatchProtect</h1>

PatchProtect is a Prop Protection for Garry's Mod.
The special thing is that this Prop Protection also includes an AntiSpam-Fuction to reduce lags cause of Spam-Noobs.

<b>Note: </b>At the moment, the full Prop Protection works. But since that time we wrote this, there was no function for buddies or something like this! So please keep that in mind. We will add this very soon!

<b>PLEASE ALSO KEEP IN MIND, THAT YOU CAN DISABLE THIS PROP PROTECTION TO USE ANOTHER PROP PROTECTION YOU WANT. So you are able to only use AntiSpam.</b>

<h1>Usage of PatchProtect</h1>
You can control the Settings in the <b>Q-Menu > Utilities</b>. There, if you are an admin, you can change all variables and also what should happen, if someone is spamming.
