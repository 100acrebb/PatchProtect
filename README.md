<h1>PatchProtect</h1>

PatchProtect is a Prop Protection for Garry's Mod 13.

<h2>Why we recommend, using PatchProtect?</h2>

<h3>Lagfree and highest Performance</h3>
We try to keep the CPU-Usage as low as possible to save resources for the server and keep it lagfree from PatchProtect

<h3>AntiSpam</h3>
In this Prop Protection, we offer a nice working <b>AntiSpam-Function</b> so that people are not able to spam around.
<b>Also you can change following things:</b>
- Enable/Disable AntiSpam
- How long till next Prop-Spawn/Tool-Fire
- You can Enable/Disable seperate from the general AntiSpam-Switch
- Enable/Disable Prop-Block
- Enable/Disable Tool-Block
- Set only Tool-AntiSpam from choosen Tools (Controlled by a nice-looking Panel)

<h3>Simple but Functional</h3>
Also we are pleased to keep the code as simple as possible, to prevent irritations or other things like that.
On the other hand we keep adding new functions to give you more freedom to control and more abilties to set things you want.

<h3>3 Panels for a good overview</h3>
The Panels are <b>AntiSpam, Prop Protection and Cleanup</b>.

Every Panel has Labels to split the functions in there specific sections

E.g.
AntiSpam ( MainSwitch, Blocking, Spawn delay's )
PropProtection ( MainSwitch, Protections, Prop Cleanup on disconnect )
Cleanup ( cleanup everything, cleanup disconnected player's props, cleanup specific player's props )

<h3>Bug fixing</h3>
We try to keep a fast service: If someone posts an error on GitHub or on Workshop, we try to fix the problem as soon as possible. But please have in mind, that we are students, so it is not possible all the time.
- Also we try to improve it as much as we can in case of performance and functions. But we will try to keep it as simple as possible.


<b>Note: </b>The latest version on GitHub works perfect. The only last thing, which is still missing is the Buddy-Tool. But we can say to you, that we already began coding it and it will be available on Patcher56' next Commit. But there will also come other commits too, to improve something or clean something up.
<b>For sure, we can say, that the next update on workshop will include the Buddy-System! (Of course, we will offer patchnotes of every update, to keep you informed about the newest changes!)</b>
