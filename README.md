<h1>PatchProtect</h1>

PatchProtect is a Prop Protection for Garry's Mod. (Fully written in Garry's Mod 13!)

<h1>There are some special things:</h1>
- Lagfree, simple and stable Anti-Spam Function (You can Enable/Disable it!)
- PropProtection with a low CPU useage and some other special features we offer (You can Enable/Disable it!)
- Good-Looking Panel with not only one entry in the Q-Menu, to keep an overview of all settings you can set
- We try to keep a fast service: If someone posts an error on GitHub or on Workshop, we try to fix the problem as fast as possible. But please have in mind, that we are students, so we are not available all the time
- Also we try to improve it as much as we can in case of performance and functions. But we will try to keep it as simple as possible.

<b>Note: </b>At the moment, the whole PropProtection works without any known bugs.
Only a Buddy-Function is still missing in our PropProtection, but we try to push an update as soon as possible to add this, so please be patient, if we send an update to workshop. <b>(Of course, we will offer patchnotes of every update, to keep you informed about the newest changes!)</b>

<h1>Usage of PatchProtect:</h1>
You can control the Settings in the <b>Q-Menu > Utilities</b>. There, if you are an admin, you can change all settings and also what should happen, if someone is spamming. (Don't forget to press the Save-Button!)
There is also a Cleanup-Menu, where you can cleanup everything on the server, or cleanup props from a special player, or cleanup all props, which are from disconnected players.
